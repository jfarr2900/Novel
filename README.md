# Novel for the broken
This is a collection of observations about the current state of the human condition.
I keep dive into the human condition from a gender role perspective to help individuals struggling. 
The current situation of the majority from a socialistic and environmental perspective. 
This collection will contain many anecdotes and personal observations of both male and female gender specific roles as well as give insight into the current gender fluidity movement.
RReal life situations gathered from years of study and immersion into the human condition and real life facts that have been gained through real experiences from real people.
A basic timeline highlighting theoretical cause and effect projections of the disconnect between the masculine and feminine psyche.
How the lines between gender role, gender freedom, and gender obscurity have not only been blurred but completely dissolved. 
Additional insights and observations on the effects manifesting in adult males from a collective and individual perspective
How this inevitably affects men and women from a socialistic perspective.
I believe that we are extremely powerful when we work together and when empower each other, If my experience, thoughts, or analysis can help even one person in the world better understand themselves, their place in the world, or even that they are not alone, then the time and effort put into this project will be worth it.
